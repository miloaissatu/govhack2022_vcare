# #GovHack2022: V-care

#GovHack2022 MATRIX - Project 1927

Challenge: [Meeting short term health needs outside of a hospital](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/meeting_short_term_health_needs_outside_of_a_hospital)

## Problem Statement

## Pain Points

Anecdotes
* [Coordination of health care: patient and primary care factors associated with potentially preventable hospitalisations for chronic conditions](https://github.com/miloaissatu/govhack2022_vcare/blob/main/Datasets/aihw-chc-8.pdf):

  > The findings of our study are consistent with other studies, which also find that the health of individuals is the most important factor driving PPH admissions (Falster et. al. 2015, Tran et. al. 2014, Khanna, et. al. 2019, Youens et. al., 2019), but they also point to the importance of access to GPs in chronic condition management. Barriers to access such as cost or poor GP availability does not differ substantially by hospitalisation type (or for those without hospitalisations).

* [Disparities in potentially preventable hospitalisations across Australia, 2012–13 to 2017–18](https://github.com/miloaissatu/govhack2022_vcare/blob/main/Datasets/aihw-hpf-50.pdf)

  > The report confirms findings from previous studies, showing that between 2012–13 and 2017–18: 
  > 
  > ...
  > 
  > • PPH rates were substantially higher for Indigenous Australians than for Other
Australians.
  >
  > • PPH rates increased with increasing socioeconomic disadvantage and remoteness.
  >
  > ...
  >
  > This report has further observed that between 2012–13 and 2017–18:
  >
  > • Hospitalisations for Pneumonia and influenza (vaccine-preventable) had a substantial impact on PPH rates.
  >
  > ...
  >
  > • Some PPH conditions showed predictable seasonal trends that can be incorporated into
management strategies.

## Idea Proposal

### Solution Themes

Emphasis on potentially preventable hospitalisations (PPH) and avoidance of Emergency Departments (ED) for lower urgency care through personalised guidance to appropriate care touch points.

* Self-care for acute conditions (pharmacy / over the counter)
* Telephony/video channels for medical consultations with appropriate professional (telehealth nurses / doctors)
* Recommended local medical resources (GP, labs, etc)
* Proactive care/advise for seasonal ailments (vaccination programs)
* Personalised prompts for regular care (chronic conditions, general upkeep e.g. dental care)
* Ease of access to medical advice and resources
* Data gathering from users of platform to inform local initiatives e.g. frequency of mobile clinic/lab visits.
