  > The findings of our study are consistent with other studies, which also find that the health of individuals is the most important factor driving PPH admissions (Falster et. al. 2015, Tran et. al. 2014, Khanna, et. al. 2019, Youens et. al., 2019), but they also point to the importance of access to GPs in chronic condition management. Barriers to access such as cost or poor GP availability does not differ substantially by hospitalisation type (or for those without hospitalisations).

aged 45 and over
2016</a></summary>

  > One of the most commonly reported reasons for not seeing a GP when needed was that there was no appointment available. There are potential flow-on effects of not being able to see a GP when needed because of long waiting times, or not being able to get an appropriate appointment time.
  > 
  > Not being able to get an appointment when needed can be associated with increased emergency department use. A study of unnecessary use of emergency departments by older people in Adelaide found that the lack of availability of GP services appeared to be a contributing factor to presenting at an emergency department (Faulkner & Law, 2015). The patient responses in that study potentially highlight a difficulty in obtaining an appropriate GP appointment time when needed, which is consistent with the findings of this report.

  > 
  > Patients living in Remote and very remote areas were more likely than those in Major cities to report that the reason for not seeing a GP or specialist was because there were no GPs or specialists nearby. The undersupply and uneven distribution of medical professionals in rural regions is well documented.

  > This report has found some associations between some patient sociodemographic characteristics and patient-reported barriers to accessing health-care services. But there are also environmental and social factors—such as a lack of culturally acceptable services or long waiting lists or waiting times— beyond a patient’s control that affect access to health care. These many factors all need to be taken into account when developing policies and future plans to address issues of access to health care.

## Idea Proposal

### Solution Themes

Emphasis on potentially preventable hospitalisations (PPH) and avoidance of Emergency Departments (ED) for lower urgency care through personalised guidance to appropriate care touch points.

* Self-care for acute conditions (pharmacy / over the counter)
* Telephony/video channels for medical consultations with appropriate professional (telehealth nurses / doctors)
* Recommended local medical resources (GP, labs, etc)
* Proactive care/advise for seasonal ailments (vaccination programs)
* Personalised prompts for regular care (chronic conditions, general upkeep e.g. dental care)
* Ease of access to medical advice and resources
* Data gathering from users of platform to inform local initiatives e.g. frequency of mobile clinic/lab visits.
